# CQ-NIR
We introduce to learn neural implicit representations with quantized coordinates, which reduces the uncertainty and ambiguity in the field during optimization.

## Installation

We provide CQ-NIR on 2 baselines, UNISURF and NeuS.

#### UNISURF
Make sure that you have all dependencies in place.
You can create an anaconda environment called `unisurf` , you can find out the instruction [here](https://github.com/autonomousvision/unisurf/tree/main). 

#### NeuS
Make sure that you have all dependencies in place.
You can create an anaconda environment called `neus` , you can find out the instruction [here](https://github.com/Totoro97/NeuS).



## Dataset

#### UNISURF

Download the sequences of Dataset generated by the authors of UNISURF, you can find out the data [here](https://github.com/autonomousvision/unisurf/tree/main). 

#### NeuS

## Training
#### UNISURF
For training a UNISURF model from scratch run

```
cd unisurf_cq
python train.py configs/DTU/scan_0$id.yaml
```

#### NeuS
For training a NeuS model from scratch
- **Training without mask**

```shell
python exp_runner.py --mode train --conf ./confs/womask.conf --case <case_name>
```

- **Training with mask**

```shell
python exp_runner.py --mode train --conf ./confs/wmask.conf --case <case_name>
```
